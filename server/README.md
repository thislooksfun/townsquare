## Live session server
This is the home of the NodeJS live session backend.
It allows a Storyteller and their player to communicate through
a Websocket interface with each other.

In order to run it, you need a recent NodeJS version (v12+) and a set
of SSL Certificate and Key files in order to run the socket through
a secured connection.

### Local setup

To run the backend locally, use the following commands from the project root:

```shell
npm install
cd server/
NODE_ENV=development node index.js
```

This will open the backend server on `localhost:8081` and you
need to adjust your `/src/store/socket.js` file to connect to
the localhost backend.

### Live setup

Generate a `cert.pem` and `key.pem` file for the domain that your
live session backend will be available under, for example with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
Copy or symlink these 2 files into your `server/` folder and then run
the following commands from the project root:

```shell
npm install
cd server/
node index.js
```

This will make the backend server available at your domain on port 8080.
If you want to have it automatically recover on crash or server restart,
you could use [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) with the provided `ecosystem.config.js`

### Allowing access from different domains

Currently the backend server only accepts connections coming from
[botc.thislooks.fun](https://botc.thislooks.fun). If you want to use your own
domain for the page, make sure to adjust the domain whitelist pattern
around line 15 in the `index.js`:

```ecmascript 6
  verifyClient: info =>
    !!info.origin.match(
      /^https?:\/\/your\.custom\.domain/i
    )
```
