This is a big release to rework some features the way I want them and add some missing stuff as well.
The major version bump is to differentiate my changes from those in the base project.

- Add an option to show team (townsfolk/outsider/minion/demon) colors for all players
- Add an option to show a warning if a player's team/character doesn't match their character token (i.e. Good/Evil/Drunk tokens)
- Make pronouns always visible

---

## Version 2.0.0
- The project is now available under its own domain: [botc.thislooks.fun](https://botc.thislooks.fun)
- Added a feature that allows a live session Storyteller to automatically (and safely) distribute assigned
  characters to all players that have claimed a seat, eliminating the need to manually tell every player their role
- Visible "night phase" that can be toggled by the Storyteller
- Voting history added with nomination and vote results
- Optional, audible voting countdown added (featuring an actual clock tower bell!)
- Fabled show up on the Night Order sheet and affect Grimoire night order counters
- Current game state can now be easily exported and imported in the form of a JSON text code
- Voting can be paused and sped up / slowed down in 0.5 second increments by the Storyteller
- Voting terminology changed to "Hand UP" / "Hand DOWN" and iconography updated
- Added meta-data support for custom scripts, that currently supports `name`, `author` and a custom `logo` through a
  `_meta` role (note that a customized logo will not be synced to players in a live session)
- Players can no longer claim seats that are already occupied and only the Storyteller can vacate seats of other players
  (players can still vacate their own seat)
- Characters selected in the bluff window now also show up in the list of reminder tokens
- Homebrew scripts / custom characters no longer automatically load in live sessions, for 2 reasons:
  - the players in a live session have no control over the script that the storyteller loads,
    so a malicious storyteller could load a custom script that contains harmful / inappropriate images
  - some homebrew scripts are quite big JSON files and synching these through the live session
    server can cause traffic / performance issue easily
  - this change may be reverted in the future when I figure out a way to sync custom characters safely and without
    such a big impact on performance constraints
- Buggy (spamming) live session connections will now be terminated on the server side and display an error message
- Balloonist reminder tokens adjusted
- Live session URLs shortened
- Deus Ex Fiasco and Stormcatcher Fabled added / updated
- Custom Reminder text looks better when there is a lot of text
- added a README for the backend server
